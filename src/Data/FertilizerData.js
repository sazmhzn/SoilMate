A lack of nitrogen causes the lower leaves to turn yellow and the whole plant to turn pale green.Phosphorous is needed for cell division and help form roots flowers and fruits.Phosphorous deficiency causes stunted growth and poor flowering and fruiting.Potassium is important for regulation of water and nutrient movement in plant cells, there by promoting fruiting ,flowering, hardiness and promote the overall health of the plant by providing resistance to diseases. A Potassium shortage show up in various ways but stun growth and yellowish lower leaves.Usage Instruction:seeds and seedling stage use 1/4 tsp to 1 liter water.After 3-4 true leaves stage use 1/2 tsp to 1 liter water . blooming stage use 2/3 tsp n-p-k to 1 liter water."

Of this 90% of Nitrogen is present in Ammonical form and the rest in Amide form. However, the entire Nitrogen is available to crops in Ammonical form. It contains 20% Phosphate, 85% of which is present in water-soluble form and is effectively and easily available to crops. It contains 15% Sulphur which is the 4th major nutrient after NPK. Sulphur response in many crops has been reported very encouraging and application of GROMOR 20-20-0-13 will supplement the Sulphur requirement of crops. It is granular in nature and can be easily applied by broadcasting, placement or drilling. Hygroscopic nature is much less and it is suitable to a variety of soils and crops. It is an excellent fertilizer for all crops grown in Sulphur deficient soils and is highly suitable for Sulphur loving crops such as Oilseeds."
